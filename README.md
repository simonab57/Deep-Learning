## Overview of the Analysis: Deep Learning
The purpose of this analysis is to create an a binary classification model using a deep learning neural network as a risk management associate at a venture capital that predicts whether start-up applicants will be successful if funded. The first part of this project prepares the data that will be ready to be used for the neural network model. Neural Network models are powerful machine learning algorithims that solve classification and regression models when dealing with large datasets. After this step is completed, we will then compile and evaluate a binary classification model using a neural network. Creating a neural network involves three components: number of inputs (data selected to be analyzed). number of neurons for each layer  (neurons perform individual computations), and number of output (reports the outcome of the value). The final stage of this project is to optimize the neual network to improve the model accuracy, ways to improve its accuracy include adding hidden layers, number of neurons in each layers, outputs, and more.
